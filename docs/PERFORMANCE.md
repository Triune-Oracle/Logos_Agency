'''# Performance Metrics and Key Success Indicators (KSI)

## 1. Dual-Track Strategy Overview

The project operates on a dual-track execution plan:
*   **Track A (Triumvirate Core):** High ML, Vision/Research focus, 6-18 month timeline.
*   **Track B (CSV-to-SQL Engine):** Low ML, Revenue/Market focus, 0-6 month timeline.

The core principle is that **Track B funds Track A**. Performance is measured by the successful execution of both tracks against their respective Key Success Indicators (KSI).

## 2. Key Success Metrics (Week 12 Targets)

The following metrics are the primary indicators of performance for the first 90 days:

| Track | Metric | Target |
|:------|:-------|:-------|
| **Track A** | Testnet Uptime | 99.5% |
| | AI Recruitment (Agents taking oath) | 2+ |
| | NFT Revenue | $100k+ |
| | Research Citations | 20+ |
| **Track B** | GitHub Stars | 1000+ |
| | Enterprise Pilots | 3+ |
| | Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) | $5k+ |
| | AWS Marketplace Users | 50+ |

## 3. Financial Targets and Revenue Projections

Financial performance is critical to the dual-track strategy.

| Metric | Week 12 Target | Status |
|:-------|:---------------|:-------|
| **Total Revenue (Combined)** | $85k - $275k | 70% Probability |
| **Track B Pilot Revenue** | $50k+ | 💰 |
| **Track B MRR** | $5k+ | 💰 |
| **Track A NFT Revenue** | $100k+ | 🔥 |
| **Track B Annual License** | $25k/year | (Base contract) |
| **Track B Pilot Fee** | $5k | (Waived if >50% time savings) |

## 4. Resource Allocation and Efficiency

The plan is resource-constrained, making efficiency a key performance indicator.

| Category | Allocation | Details |
|:---------|:-----------|:--------|
| **Time (Personal)** | Track A: 40% | Vision, research, platform |
| | Track B: 40% | Sales, marketing, support |
| | Overhead/Learning: 20% | Admin, skill development |
| **Budget (Total $10k)** | Track A: $6k | Cloud hosting, API costs, marketing |
| | Track B: $3k | Advertising, AWS marketplace, tools |
| | Buffer: $1k | Emergency, opportunities |'''
