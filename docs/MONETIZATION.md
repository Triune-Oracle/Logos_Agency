'''# Monetization Strategy and Financial Targets

## 1. Dual-Track Monetization Strategy

The project employs a dual-track monetization strategy, where the immediate revenue-generating Track B (CSV-to-SQL Engine) is designed to fund the long-term, high-vision Track A (Triumvirate Core).

The core strategic principle is that **Track B funds Track A**.

| Track | Engine | Primary Revenue Model | Secondary Revenue Model |
|:------|:-------|:----------------------|:------------------------|
| **Track A** | Triumvirate Core | NFT Tokenization (Knowledge Artifacts) | Research Grants, Academic Partnerships |
| **Track B** | CSV-to-SQL | Enterprise Annual Licensing | AWS Marketplace Subscriptions, Pilot Fees |

## 2. Financial Targets and Revenue Projections (90-Day Outlook)

The following targets are set for the first 90 days of execution:

| Metric | Week 12 Target | Status | Notes |
|:-------|:---------------|:-------|:------|
| **Total Revenue (Combined)** | $85k - $275k | 70% Probability | Aggressive target combining both tracks. |
| **Track B Pilot Revenue** | $50k+ | 💰 | Revenue from successful pilot conversions. |
| **Track B MRR** | $5k+ | 💰 | Monthly Recurring Revenue from subscriptions. |
| **Track A NFT Revenue** | $100k+ | 🔥 | Revenue from the sale of Triumvirate knowledge NFTs. |

| **Track A Budget** | $6k | Cloud hosting, API costs, marketing for Triumvirate Core. |
