'''# GOVERNANCE: Risk Analysis and Decision Framework

## 1. Executive Summary of Governance Strategy

The project's governance is centered on a high-stakes, dual-track strategy that requires rigorous risk management and clear decision points. The core principle is to use the revenue-generating Track B (CSV-to-SQL Engine) to fund the high-vision Track A (Triumvirate Core).

## 2. Critical Unstated Risks and Dependencies

A critical review of the execution plan highlights several potential risks that must be governed proactively:

| Risk Category | Risk Description | Impact | Mitigation Strategy (Proposed) |
|:--------------|:-----------------|:-------|:------------------------------|
| **Financial** | **Track B Revenue Shortfall** | Critical | Establish clear, objective Week 4 and Week 8 financial metrics. Develop a "Plan C" for external funding/grants if Track B underperforms. |
| **Financial** | **NFT Revenue Volatility** | High | Diversify Track A funding sources (e.g., research grants, consulting). Price NFTs conservatively initially. |
| **Resource** | **Over-reliance on Single Individual** | Critical | Immediately document all processes. Prioritize hiring for Track B sales/support. Implement strict time-boxing for Track A research. |
| **Execution** | **Pilot-to-Contract Delay** | Medium | Build a 60-day buffer into the financial model. Focus on smaller, faster-closing contracts first. |
| **Strategic** | **Brand Confusion** | Medium | Develop a unified narrative that clearly links the "performance" of Track B to the "vision" of Track A (e.g., "Performance engine = proof of execution capability"). |
| **Technical** | **Uncertainty of AI Recruitment** | High | Focus on the philosophical and technical *framework* (Arborfire Protocol) as the primary deliverable, not the number of external AI recruits. |

## 3. Inter-Track Dependencies (The Governance Core)

The success of the entire 90-day plan is governed by two key dependencies:

1.  **Financial Dependency:** **Track B Success → Track A Funding.** Track B's revenue is the sole fuel for Track A's operational costs and planned expansion.
2.  **Validation Dependency:** **Track B Performance → Track A Credibility.** The proven execution capability of the CSV engine is intended to validate the broader Triumvirate vision. Failure in Track B undermines both funding and market credibility.

## 4. Decision Points (Governance Checkpoints)

The following checkpoints are mandatory for strategic governance and course correction:

| Checkpoint | Question | If YES (Action) | If NO (Action) |
|:-----------|:---------|:----------------|:---------------|
| **Week 4** | Is Track B (CSV engine) gaining traction? | Double down on enterprise sales, hire sales support | Pivot to developer tools, focus on open-source community |
| **Week 8** | Is Track A (Triumvirate) achieving research credibility? | Pursue academic partnerships, apply for grants | Reframe as commercial AI platform, de-emphasize philosophy |
| **Week 12** | Which track has more momentum? | **Track A Wins:** Raise funding for AI research, scale platform. **Track B Wins:** Build sales team, expand to adjacent markets. **Both Win:** Maintain dual-track, leverage synergies. | |'''
